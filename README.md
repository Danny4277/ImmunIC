# ImmunIC
ImmunIC (Immune cell Identifier and Classifier) is a tool for immune cell identification and classificaiton from single cell RNA sequencing data. ImmunIC takes a single input of a gene count matrix to dentify immune cells and classify immune cells into B cells, plasma cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, NK cells, monocytes, dendritic cells, macrophages, neutrophils and other myeloid cells. ImmunIC uses the predetermined leukocyte gene signature matrix [LM22](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.3337) along with [Xgboost](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2939672.2939785). More details are provided in our publication.
